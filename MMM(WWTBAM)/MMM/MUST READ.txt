You will know whether you have the second set on screen because I have
 labeled it in the first question.

To add extra Questions's



1: I will be adding somemore to planet source code so look out

2: Add another module- Module8 and paste the code from Module7. I have
also put this code at the bottom of this text file

3.Change the Questions And Answers and also which is the letter with the answer: A,B,C or D
e.g.


Sub route0q1()
' Question1
c = 1  `THIS NEEDS TO BE THE SAME AS THE QUASTION NUMBER
an = "b" 'THIS IS WHICH LETTER THE ANSWER WILL BE "BUT MAKE SURE IT ISNT THE SAME AS THE NEXT ONE.  
Form1.Label20.Caption = "What is 12 squared?" 'put any question here
Form1.Label21.Caption = "10,000"
Form1.Label22.Caption = "1,000" ' answer must be put here If an = b
Form1.Label23.Caption = "-100"
Form1.Label24.Caption = "1,000,000"
End Sub



4: in module 4 change sub to:
Sub whichr()


If q = 0 Then
Call route0q1
ElseIf q = 1 Then
Call Module7.route0q1

ElseIf q = 2 Then
Call Module8.route0q1
End If
End Sub

5: Finally in form1 - sub form load, change the line "q = Int((2 * Rnd))" to:
q = Int((3 * Rnd))


After youve finished the questions it should have worked
