## Who Wants To Be a Millionairre \(MMM\)


</div>

### Description

I put this on again because I need to see what the edit function was "sorry, dont think im just trying to get more votes"

Please Vote even if its only worth 1 globe because its disrespectful to a coder to not give him/her feedback on there hardwork!!!!!!!!

This is a great ripoff of the famous Who Want To Be A Millionairre Game. it includes all the lifelines. I will be adding more sets of questions soon. This can be used freely and I hope that people would add extra features and make it better so that I can learn from it.

I am only 13 so I think Its Quite good for my age.
